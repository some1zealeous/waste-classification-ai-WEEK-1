# ♻️ Waste Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project is part of my **4-week AI/ML internship** focused on *Sustainability through Artificial Intelligence*.

The goal of this project is to build a **CNN-based Image Classification Model** that can identify types of waste (e.g., plastic, glass, paper, organic, metal) and contribute to better recycling practices.
